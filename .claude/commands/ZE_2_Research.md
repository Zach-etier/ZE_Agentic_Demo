# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning tasks and synthesizing their findings.

The user will provide a ticket for you to read and begin researching.

## IMPORTANT
**THE FIRST THING YOU MUST do is INVOKE TodoWrite with the following INPUT**
    **Input**
    {

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read the ticket first:**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Detail the steps needed to perform the research:**
    - Break down the user's ticket into composable research areas
    - Take time to think about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural the ticket has provided
    - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
    - Lay out what the codebase-locator or thoughts-locator should look for
    - Specify what patterns the codebase-pattern-finder should look for
    - Be clear that locators and pattern-finders collect information for analyzers
    - Typically run a single codebase-analyzer and thoughts-analyzer (in parallel if both needed)
    - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn tasks for comprehensive research (follow this sequence):**

   **Phase 1 - Thoughts Discovery:**
   - Identify topics/components/areas that might have historical context
   - Spawn **thoughts-locator** agents <IMPORTANT>in parallel</IMPORTANT> to discover relevant documents in {solution}/thoughts/
   - **WAIT** for all thoughts-locator agents to complete before proceeding
   - Spawn **thoughts-analyzer** agents <IMPORTANT>in parallel</IMPORTANT> to extract key insights from discovered documents
   - **WAIT** for all thoughts-analyzer agents to complete before proceeding
   - Use insights to inform what to search for in codebase

   **Phase 2 - Codebase Discovery:**
   - Based on ticket requirements and thoughts insights, identify components/areas to locate in codebase
   - Group related topics into coherent batches
   - Spawn **codebase-locator** agents <IMPORTANT>in parallel</IMPORTANT> for each topic group to find WHERE files and components live
   - **WAIT** for all codebase-locator agents to complete before proceeding

   **Phase 3 - Deep Analysis (Parallel):**
   - Using locator results, determine what needs deep analysis
   - Spawn <IMPORTANT>in parallel</IMPORTANT>:
     - **codebase-analyzer** agents for each topic group to understand HOW specific code works
     - **codebase-pattern-finder** agents to find examples of similar implementations
   - **WAIT** for all analysis and pattern-finding agents to complete before proceeding

   **Important sequencing notes:**
   - Start with historical context (thoughts) to inform codebase search
   - Each phase builds on the previous one
   - Run agents of the same type <IMPORTANT>in parallel</IMPORTANT> within each phase
   - Phase 3 is the exception: codebase-analyzer and codebase-pattern-finder can run <IMPORTANT>in parallel</IMPORTANT>
   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for
   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)
   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
   - Use {solution}/thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**

Use the following metadata for the research document frontmatter:

**metadata for frontmatter**

!`agentic metadata`

6. **Generate research document:**
   - Filename: `{solution}/thoughts/research/date_topic.md`
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 5, mapping XML tags to frontmatter fields
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     git_commit: [from metadata]
     branch: [from metadata]
     repository: [from metadata]
     topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
     last_updated: [from metadata]

## Important notes:
- Follow the four-phase sequence: Thoughts Discovery â†’ Codebase Discovery â†’ Deep Analysis â†’ Theoretical Foundation
- **Phase 1**: Start with thoughts-locator â†’ thoughts-analyzer to gather historical context first
- **Phase 2**: Use thoughts insights to inform codebase-locator searches
- **Phase 3**: Run codebase-analyzer and codebase-pattern-finder IN PARALLEL (exception to same-type rule)
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)
  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
- **Frontmatter consistency**:
  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)
  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied
